# README

This is the R Code associated with the analysis and figures related to the paper entitled "Searching for the earliest archaeological record: Insights from the chimpanzee material landscapes" published in the Journal of Royal Society Interface

# Using this repository

The data associated with the analyses is found in the "data" folder. It is bundled together as an R workspace. To use the data, all one needs to do is use the load() function to import the workspace. Once it is loaded all of the code contained in the "scripts" folder will run reproducing the analyses, presented in the paper.
